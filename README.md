# Tabletop Audio Tracks

Every one of the 300+ 10-minute ambience tracks from [Tabletop Audio](https://tabletopaudio.com/) in a single repo.

NB: I'm not affiliated with [Tabletop Audio](https://tabletopaudio.com/). These tracks are available freely under a [BY-NC-ND license](#license). Additional variants of each track (not included here) are available via [the author's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tabletopaudio) - please consider supporting them if you enjoy their work!

## Updates

If this repo is out of date, please open an issue noting the name of the track so that I can update it. The more technically inclined might consider submitting a PR to the appropriate metadata in `tabletop-audio-tracks.yaml`; a JSON schema for it is provided in the `schema` directory.

## Contents

Currently, this isn't much more than a mirror with some separate metadata (and a NodeJS download script you can use to DIY it).

### The Download Script

The script can be found at `download.js`. It reads `tabletop-audio-tracks.yaml`, checks the list of file names, and downloads any items missing from `tracks` one at a time. It doesn't do any scraping per se, largely because I don't know enough about scraping to code that right now ;)

In the future I may refine this script so that it can download only items with a specific tag, or all items in a playlist link generated by [Tabletop Audio](https://tabletopaudio.com/).
